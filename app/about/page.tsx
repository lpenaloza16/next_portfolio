        I'm familiar with languages such as TypeScript, Rust, Python,
        JavaScript, Java, and C++, and have used a variety of tools and
        libraries. I've also had some exposure to back-end technologies like
        Node.js, Express, and GraphQL, as well as several databases. My
        professional journey has taken me to places like BigCo and CoolStartup,
        where I've had the opportunity to learn and grow. I'm open to
        collaboration and am particularly interested in projects aimed at
        helping students or creating organizational tools.
