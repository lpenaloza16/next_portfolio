        I'm Leo Pena, a Web Developer from California, passionate about crafting
        efficient software solutions. My expertise spans JavaScript, Python,
        React, and Java, with a current focus on mastering NextJS. I thrive in
        collaborative environments, having contributed to Zero To Mastery and
        various hackathons, and I'm committed to continuous learning, as
        evidenced by my certifications and active engagement in coding
        challenges. Beyond coding, my interests in Math and Science fuel my
        creativity and analytical approach to problem-solving. I'm on the

        apply my skills, learn, and grow within an innovative team. Let's
        connect and explore how we can collaborate on future tech projects!
