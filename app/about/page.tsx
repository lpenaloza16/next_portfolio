        I have experience with languages such as TypeScript, Rust, Python,
        JavaScript, Java, and C++, and have used a variety of tools and
        libraries. I've also gained exposure to back-end technologies like
        Node.js, Express, and GraphQL, as well as several databases. Throughout
        my career, I've had the opportunity to learn and grow through various
        projects. I'm open to collaboration and am particularly interested in
        projects aimed at helping students or creating organizational tools.
